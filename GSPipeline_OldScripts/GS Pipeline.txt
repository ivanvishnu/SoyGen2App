GS Pipeline: 

Genotype & Phenotype Data Management: 

GIGWA - Genotype Investigator for Genome Wide Analyses  & PRISM database

i)  Visualization of genotypic information: TASSEL and Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) (Diversity Analyses)

ii) a) Filtering R script 

		  &
	
    b) imputation - scattered and rare missing values imputation vs high to low density imputation
	
       for scattered and rare missing values - beagle & TASSEL 

       for high to low density imputation - PHG, alphaplantImpute, Expectation based imputation method

iii) Training population optimization 

iv) prediction (Genomic selection R packages) (Accuracy) 
    and 
	selection decision

		What genotyping platform to use? 
		
		                    	Pros    	                          cons	
		Illumina 50K SNP    Good data, clean , high density               $$ 
		
		Illumina 6k         clean data, widely used 			  $$ low density


                Targeted 1K GBS(MIPS)                                         Low density, still some missing data
		 
		GBS                cheap, generally clean 

        					 High density	      Lots of missing data, requires lot of imputation  
		  
		skim seq +imputation  HD 			                 $$$ Complex bioinfo unless service used 
		  
		  
		  
		  Optimal gain/unit cost..
